my_toppings <- c("cheese", NA, NA)
my_toppings_and <- paste(c("", "", "and "), my_toppings, sep = "")

# Print my_toppings_and
print(my_toppings_and)

# Use str_c() instead of paste(): my_toppings_str
my_toppings_str <- str_c(c("", "", "and "), my_toppings)

paste(my_toppings_and, collapse = ", ")

# paste() my_toppings_str with collapse = ", "
str_c(my_toppings_and, collapse = ", ")

# Nice work! This behavior is nice because you learn quickly when you might have missing values, rather than discovering later weird "NA"s inside your strings. Another stringr function that is useful when you may have missing values, is str_replace_na() which replaces missing values with any string you choose.

# Extracting vectors for boys' and girls' names
babynames_2014 <- filter(babynames, year == 2014)
str(babynames_2014)
boy_names <- babynames_2014 %>% 
              filter(sex == "M") %>% 
              select(name)

boy_names2 <- filter(babynames_2014, sex == "M")$name

girl_names <- babynames_2014 %>% 
                filter(sex == "F") %>% 
                select(name)

girl_names2 <- filter(babynames_2014, sex == "F")$name

# Take a look at a few boy_names
head(boy_names)
head(boy_names2)
head(girl_names)
head(girl_names2)

# Find the length of all boy_names
boy_length <- str_length(boy_names)
boy_length2 <- str_length(boy_names2)

girl_length <- str_length(girl_names)
girl_length2 <- str_length(girl_names2)

# Find the difference in mean length
mean(girl_length) - mean(boy_length)
mean(girl_length2) - mean(boy_length2)

# Confirm str_length() works with factors
# head(str_length(factor(boy_names)))
head(str_length(factor(boy_names2)))

# Fantastic! The average length of the girls' names in 2014 is about 1/3 of a character longer. Just be aware this is a naive average where each name is counted once, not weighted by how many babies recevied the name. A better comparison might be an average weighted by the n column in babynames.

# Chapter 3. Extracting substrings
# Extract first letter from boy_names
boy_first_letter <- str_sub(boy_names2, 1, 1)

# Tabulate occurrences of boy_first_letter
table(boy_first_letter)

# Extract the last letter in boy_names, then tabulate
boy_last_letter <- str_sub(boy_names2, -1, -1)
table(boy_last_letter)

# Extract the first letter in girl_names, then tabulate
girl_first_letter <- str_sub(girl_names2, 1, 1)
table(girl_first_letter)

# Extract the last letter in girl_names, then tabulate
girl_last_letter <- str_sub(girl_names2, -1, -1)
table(girl_last_letter)

# Great job! Did you see that "A" is the most popular first letter for both boys and girls, and the most popular last letter for girls. However, the most popular last letter for boys' names was "n". You might have seen substr() a base R function that is similar to str_sub(). The big advantage of str_sub() is the ability to use negative indexes to count from the end of a string.

# Part 2. Hunting for matches
# Lectures
pizzas <- c("cheese", "pepperoni", "sausage and green peppers")

str_detect(string = pizzas, pattern = "pepper")

str_detect(string = pizzas, 
           pattern = fixed("pepper"))

str_subset(string = pizzas, 
           pattern = fixed("pepper"))

str_count(string = pizzas, 
          pattern = fixed("pepper"))

# Chapter 1. Detecting matches
# Look for pattern "zz" in boy_names
contains_zz <- str_detect(boy_names2, pattern = "zz")

# Examine str() of contains_zz
str(contains_zz)

# How many names contain "zz"?
sum(contains_zz == TRUE)

# Which names contain "zz"?
boy_names2[contains_zz == TRUE]

# Which rows in boy_df have names that contain "zz"?
boy_df <- babynames_2014 %>% 
  filter(sex == "M") %>% 
  select(1:5)
boy_df[contains_zz == TRUE, ]

# That last example is another common use of str_detect() subsetting a data frame to rows where the values in a column contain the pattern of interest. In this case it lets us see these double-z names are pretty rare. For example, even the most popular, Uzziah, only accounted for 0.003% of boys born in 2014.

# Chapter 2. Subsetting strings based on match
# Find boy_names that contain "zz"

# Chapter 3. Counting matches

girl_names2[total_as > 4]

chars <- c("Tom & Jerry", 
           "Alvin & Simon & Theodore")

# str_split can returns a matrix

line1 <- "The table was a large one, but the three were all crowded together at one corner of it:"
line2 <- "\"No room! No room!\" they cried out when they saw Alice coming."

# Part 4. Replacing matches in strings
# Chapter 1. Replacing to tidy strings
ids <- c("ID#: 192", "ID#: 118", "ID#: 001")

# Replace "ID#: " with ""
id_nums <- str_replace(ids, pattern = "ID#: ", replacement = "")

# Turn id_nums into numbers
id_ints <- as.numeric(id_nums)

# Some (fake) phone numbers
phone_numbers <- c("510-555-0123", "541-555-0167")

# Use str_replace() to replace "-" with " "
str_replace(phone_numbers, pattern = "-", replacement = " ")

# Use str_replace_all() to replace "-" with " "
str_replace_all(phone_numbers, pattern = "-", replacement = " ")

# Turn phone numbers into the format xxx.xxx.xxxx
str_replace_all(phone_numbers, pattern = "-", replacement = ".")

# Nice work! If you need to replace multiple different characters you could use str_replace_all() more than once, but you'll see a better way of specifying a range of characters to replace once you've learned about regular expressions in Chapter 3.
