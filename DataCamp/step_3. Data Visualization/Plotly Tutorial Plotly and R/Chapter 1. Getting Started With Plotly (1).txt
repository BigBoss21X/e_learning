# Chapter 1. Let's get started
Meet Plotly.

Plotly provides online graphing, analytics, and statistics tools. Using their technology anyone, including yourself, can make beautiful, interactive web-based graphs.

In this short tutorial, you'll be introduced to the R package for plotly, a high-level interface to the open source JavaScript graphing library plotly.js.

Plotly for R runs locally in your web browser or in the R Studio viewer. You can publish your charts to the web with plotly's web service. Let's get started by loading the plotly library.

Instructions
Load the plotly R package.

# This will create your very first plotly visualization
plot_ly(z = ~volcano)

# Chapter 2. Plotly diamonds are forever

You'll use several datasets throughout the tutorial to showcase the power of plotly. In the next exercises you will make use of the diamond dataset. A dataset containing the prices and other attributes of 1000 diamonds.

Diamonds
Don't forget:

You're encouraged to think about how the examples can be applied to your own data-sets! Also, Plotly graphs are interactive. So make sure to experiment a bit with your plot: click-drag to zoom, shift-click to pan, double-click to autoscale.

Instructions
plotly has already been loaded for you.
Take a look at the first plot_ly() graph. It plots the carat (FYI: the carat is a unit of mass. Hence it gives info on the weight of a diamond,) against the price (in US dollars). You don't have to change anything to this command. Tip: note the ~ syntax.
In the second call of plot_ly(), change the color argument. The color should be dependent on the weight of the diamond.
In the third call of plot_ly(), change the size argument as well. The size should be dependent on the weight of the diamond.
